'opencv-python' package is required if trying to run the classifying.py file<br />

Inside the Samples folder is an executable that can be run with no dependencies or libraries. <br />

Here are some examples of the images you have to sort <br />
<img src="examples/images/A0151-0016.png" width="200"><img src="examples/images/A0152-0002.png" width="200"><img src="examples/images/A0153-0011.png" width="200"><img src="examples/images/A0155-0008.png" width="200"><img src="examples/images/A0159-0022.png" width="200"><img src="examples/images/A0155-0014.png" width="200"><img src="examples/images/A0156-0012.png" width="200"><img src="examples/images/A0158-0005.png" width="200"><img src="examples/images/A0158-0022.png" width="200"><img src="examples/images/A0152-0015.png" width="200"><img src="examples/images/A0154-0023.png" width="200"> <br />

Press '0' for empty (or close to empty) crucibles <br />
Press '1' through '4' to judge how much sample is in each crucible.  <br />
With '1' being the lowest amount and '4' being highest. <br />
Pressing 'J' will skip current photo to be judged for later at the end.     <br />
Pressing 'K' will tell you how many images are left to be classified <br />
Pressing 'L' will allow you to save and quit <br />
